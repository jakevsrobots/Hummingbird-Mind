          That day, I found it impossible to concentrate. My eyelids felt like lead, and I kept finding excuses to distract myself.

          The hummingbird's feathers bristled as it peevishly alternated between two spots in the air. "That wicked cat has hidden it," it said, "I knew it, of course. Her aggressive gestures shall be punished with stern words."
