        <body>My "home office". It was really just a desk in the corner of the living room, but it was enough room for my computer and my drawer of important-things-that-should-really-be-better-organized.</body>

          I was starting to find myself having more and more trouble concentrating. My eyelids felt like lead, and I kept finding excuses to distract myself.

          I could hear the air conditioner droning in the next room. Traffic rumbled from the overpass a few blocks away. A few crickets thrummed.

          "Good afternoon." A large stork was perched on the edge of my desk. "I say, have you seen my hat?"

          "Well, it's black," said the stork, "Soft, sort of a long stocking cap. It's dreadfully clever, and has magic properties. Ring any bells?"
